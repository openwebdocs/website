Open Web Docs is thrilled to share that Will Bamberg has joined the team today as a full-time Sr. Technical Writer!

Will is an experienced technical writer and brings a great deal of institutional knowledge to the table. He previously worked on MDN at Mozilla, where among other things he wrote and maintained docs for the Firefox Devtools and the Firefox WebExtensions APIs, and [led the project to add interactive examples to MDN's reference docs](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhacks.mozilla.org%2F2018%2F03%2Fbringing-interactive-examples-to-mdn%2F)). Will joins OWD from [Element](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Felement.io), where he's been working on a new website for the Matrix Specification.

At OWD he's interested in helping make web documentation more consistent, coherent, and approachable. Will fills the second position we have budgeted and we are overjoyed to have him aboard. Please join us in welcoming Will Bamberg!
