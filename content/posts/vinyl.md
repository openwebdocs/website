Open Web Docs is thrilled to announce that [Queen Vinyl Da.i’gyu-Kazotetsu](https://github.com/queengooborg) has joined the team as a contractor to help maintain compatibility data at the [BCD project](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/).

Previously a contractor at Google and a long-time BCD community member, Vinyl has a lot of experience with compatibility on the open web. She is the number #1 contributor to the BCD repository!

Web developers expressed frustration with web compat and interoperability and we’re dedicated to help them with accurate data that power both, the MDN compatibility tables and the [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) project.

Please join me in welcoming Vinyl to Open Web Docs!
