We’re excited to welcome JetBrains to the Open Web Docs Steering Committee!

[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) is a software tooling vendor that created IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, and many other developer tools.

> “More and more people in the JavaScript and web development community are recognizing the importance of good documentation. We at JetBrains recognize it, too. For many years, we’ve equipped our IDEs with MDN documentation, helping developers find information faster and when it’s most relevant.

> For us, the OWD initiative is an amazing opportunity to support the open-source community and improve the quality of documents in the tooling used by developers on a daily basis.”

 – Piotr Tomiak, WebStorm Senior Software Developer.

With a $20k donation, JetBrains helps us to get closer to our yearly goal to fully fund four full-time Tech Writers to work on Open Web Documentation.
