Open Web Docs (OWD) is excited to support the online [Write The Docs Prague conference](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.writethedocs.org%2Fconf%2Fprague%2F2021%2F), coming this October 3-5. 

OWD team and community members will be attending the talks and participating in the Writing Day. Our goal in sponsoring this event is to learn the latest from and support our fellow documentarians, and to share our knowledge about documenting the Web platform.

Lola Odelola, Developer Advocate at Samsung, has been driving community enablement:

> “As part of our community enablement goals for this year, we want to build relationships with the wider writing and developer community. Collaboration has been the driving force behind technical documentation, in particular MDN, and the online writing space is strong because of the numerous writers and developers who contribute to it.” 

Samsung Internet and Microsoft are generously underwriting our sponsorship through additional financial support to our Open Collective fund.

We’re also looking forward to working with our partner, Daniel Beck of Mozilla, on the Write the Docs Writing Day where we are facilitating a session about contributing to MDN Web Docs.

We’re looking forward to meeting the WTD community and working on improving the reliability and sustainability of web platform documentation. We hope to see you there!
