If you're interested in helping to ensure that the Web has high-quality accessible documentation, available to everyone, here are some of the ways you can help us out.

## Contribute to MDN Web Docs

We think [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is the best web docs site out there, and we spend most of our time maintaining and extending it, mostly through contributions to the [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content) repo.

- If you find a problem on MDN, please [file an issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues).

- If you see an issue on MDN that you know how to fix, please [make a pull request](https://github.com/mdn/content/pulls). The [mdn/content README](https://github.com/mdn/content) has instructions for contributing to the repo, and we're always happy to provide guidance for contributors.

## Donate to Open Web Docs

You can support our work by making a donation through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/).
