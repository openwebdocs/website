If you're interested in helping to ensure that the Web has high-quality accessible documentation, available to everyone, here are some of the ways you can help us out.

## Contribute to MDN Web Docs

We think [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is the best web docs site out there, and we spend most of our time maintaining and extending it, mostly through contributions to the [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content) repo.

If you'd like to help out with this work, a great place to start is by fixing issues in mdn/content. The [mdn/content README](https://github.com/mdn/content) has instructions for contributing to the repo.

Have a look at the [issue backlog](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues). Issues include typos, errors, things that are not clear, as well as requests for new documentation. If you're getting started, have a look at the issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), but you don't have to restrict yourself to this list. If you want to take an issue, ask us to assign it to you. Please feel free to ask for help â€” we're always happy to provide guidance for contributors.

If you'd like to propose a bigger change, we track potential Open Web Docs projects as issues in the [openwebdocs/project](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues) repository. Please file an issue there and we'll consider it in our project planning. If you'd like to help out with a proposal we have already listed, comment on the issue. We'd love to talk to you about it.

## Attend an event

We host and attend writing events such as the Writing Day at the [Write the Docs Prague conference in 2021](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2021/writing-day/). We come with a list of projects for you to work on, or you can bring your own, and we will help you get started. [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs) to learn about events we'll be at!
